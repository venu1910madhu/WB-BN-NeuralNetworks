White-box models are the type of models which one can clearly explain how they behave, how they produce predictions and what the influencing variables are. There are two key elements that make a model white-box: features have to be understandable, and the ML process has to be transparent







A neural network is a black box in the sense that while it can approximate any function, studying its structure won't give you any insights on the structure of the function being approximated.
