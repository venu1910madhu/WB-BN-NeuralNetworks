White-box models are preferred over black-box models in estimating black carbon because they are closer to physics-based models, and it is easier to spot the relative importance of the predictor variable. The black carbon model could serve as a virtual sensor integrating into air quality network in support with real measurements, so as to complement the current air quality index.


A neural network is a black box in the sense that while it can approximate any function, studying its structure won't give you any insights on the structure of the function being approximated.
